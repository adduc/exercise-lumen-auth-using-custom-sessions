# Exercise: Lumen Authentication through Custom Session Guard

This repository contains a proof of concept showcasing how a custom
guard can be added to Lumen to handle authenticating users with
sessions.

Note: I ran into issues using Laravel's session guard initially which
lead to this exercise. I have since been able to use Laravel's session
guard successfully within Lumen. Check 
[adduc/exercise-lumen-auth-using-sessions] for further information.
